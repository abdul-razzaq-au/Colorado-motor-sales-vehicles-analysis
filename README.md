# Colorado-motor-sales-vehicles-analysis
Analyzed Colorado motor vehicle sales (2008–2015) using R for data cleaning, EDA, YoY analysis, and ARIMA forecasting. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to explore trends, seasonality, and county-wise sales performance.

# Colorado Motor Vehicle Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing motor vehicle sales data from the state of Colorado to identify sales trends, seasonal patterns, and insights across time. Statistical analysis and visualization techniques are applied using R, along with an interactive Power BI dashboard for business-oriented insights.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Colorado motor vehicle sales data
- Identify trends and patterns in vehicle sales over time
- Analyze variations across different periods and categories
- Present insights through statistical analysis and interactive dashboards

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical motor vehicle sales information for Colorado, including time-based sales figures and related attributes.  
- Source: Public / academic dataset  
- Data is used strictly for educational and analytical purposes


## Tools & Technologies
- **R**
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Statistical analysis
- **Power BI**
  - Interactive dashboard and visual storytelling
- **Libraries Used (R)**
  - tidyverse
  - dplyr
  - ggplot2
  - lubridate
  - forecast (if applicable)

## Methodology
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory analysis using summary statistics and visualizations
- Trend and pattern identification over time
- Dashboard creation in Power BI for intuitive insights

## Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard (`.pbix`) is included in this repository to visualize:
- Sales trends over time
- Comparative analysis across periods
- Key performance indicators

Screenshots can be viewed directly, while the `.pbix` file can be opened using Power BI Desktop.

## Results & Insights
- Clear upward and downward trends in vehicle sales were identified
- Seasonal patterns were observed across different time periods
- Visual analytics helped highlight key variations in sales performance

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into Colorado’s motor vehicle sales trends and demonstrates the application of statistical analysis and business intelligence tools to real-world data.
